<a name="started"></a><h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>Begin by visiting the <a href="downloads.jsp">Downloads</a> page and downloading a copy of DDMSence. The tutorials below will assume that you are working
with the "bin"-flavored download, which comes with the DDMSence JAR files pre-compiled, and contains source code for the sample applications.</p>

<p>Unzip the downloaded archive in a directory of your choice. You can then run the samples from the command line by entering the commands below (or by pasting them
into a batch/shell script and running that script):</p>

<pre class="brush: xml">REM Windows Commands
cd &lt;folderWhereDDMSenceIsUnzipped&gt;\ddmsence-bin-@ddmsence.version@

to change the version numbers in the classpath examples.</p>

<a name="samples"></a><h4>Sample Applications</h4>
<!-- DDMScargo(t), DDMScrow, DDMSophagus, DDMSpresso, DDMStrogen, DDMStuary, DDMSquire, DDMSteem, DDMStablishment, DDMStimator, DDMScalator, DDMState -->

DDMSence comes with three sample applications. The intention of these applications is to highlight notable aspects of DDMSence, not to create
real-world solutions.</p>

<h5>Essentials</h5>

<p><u>Essentials</u> is a simple reader application which loads an XML file containing a DDMS Resource and displays it in three different formats: the
original XML, HTML, and Text. The source code for this application provides an example of how to create DDMS components from an XML file.</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="tutorials-01.jsp">Tutorial #1: Essentials</a></li>
</ul>

<h5>Escort</h5>

<p><u>Escort</u> is a step-by-step wizard for building a DDMS Resource from scratch, and then saving it to a file. The source code for this application
shows an example of how the Java object model can be built with simple data types.</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<img src="images/escape-thumb.png" width="300" height="198" title="Escape Screenshot" align="right" />

<h5>Escape</h5>

<p><u>Escape</u> is a tool that traverses multiple DDMS Resource files and then exposes various statistics about them through the 
<a href="http://code.google.com/apis/visualization/documentation/gallery.html" target="_new">Google Visualization API</a>. Charts in this sample
application are non-interactive, but provide the foundation for more complex cases: for example, it would
be possible to plot Temporal Coverage on an 
<a href="http://code.google.com/apis/visualization/documentation/gallery/annotatedtimeline.html" target="_new">Annotated Timeline</a>, or Geospatial Coverage on 
<a href="http://code.google.com/apis/visualization/documentation/gallery/map.html" target="_new">Google Maps</a>.</p>

<a name="javadoc"></a><h4>JavaDoc API Documentation</h4>

<img src="images/docSample.png" width="305" height="273" title="JavaDoc sample" align="right" />

<ul>
	<li><a href="docs/">Online API Documentation</a></li>
</ul>
The API documentation is also bundled with the "bin"-flavored download on the <a href="downloads.jsp">Downloads</a> page, and can be generated from source code 
in the "src"-flavored download. Classes which represent DDMS elements are grouped into packages based on which of the five 
core sets they belong to. In some cases, packages are further divided to identify any components which originate from other 
XML namespaces, such as GML or XLink. If a component is reused across multiple sets, it will be found in the package of the 
set where it was first introduced.</p>
<p>The overview page contains a quick reference chart of all implemented DDMS components. Drill down to a specific component class to find the following information in a standard format:
<ul>
	<li><b>Overview</b>: The versions of DDMS that this component exists in, along with any important component details.</li>
	<li><b>History</b>: How the class implementation has evolved through different versions of DDMSence.</li>
	<li><b>Nested Elements</b>: The child elements of this component, their cardinality, and which versions of DDMS they exist in.</li>
	<li><b>Attributes</b>: The attributes of this component, their cardinality, and which versions of DDMS they exist in.</li>
	<li><b>Validation Rules</b>: The rules that DDMSence checks for validity, whether the rule triggers an error or warning, and which versions of DDMS they exist in.</li>
</ul>

<a name="useCases"></a><h3>Suggested Use Cases</h3>

<p>This section describes common use cases that are a good fit for the DDMSence library. The term, "metacard", refers to DDMS 2.0 through 4.1 resources. The term, "assertion", refers
to DDMS 5.0 resources. For the purposes of these use cases, the terms are interchangeable.</p>

<h4>Reading existing metacards</h4>

<p>As the tutorials show, it is trivially easy for DDMSence to load a DDMS metacard from an XML file, examine its contents in a Java way, and display it as XML, HTML or Text. If you
have a search web service which queries a catalog of DDMS metacards, DDMSence could be used to process those metacards individually, or gather statistics about the catalog as a whole.
You could also use DDMSence to quickly validate a collection of DDMS metacards, simply by loading them into a DDMSReader.</p>

<h4>Creating new metacards</h4>

<p>There are two ways to create DDMS metacards from scratch in DDMSence. The first way makes use of standard Java constructors to build up each component and then group them together
into a complete DDMS metacard. The second way uses the <a href="documentation-builders.jsp">Component Builder</a> framework to model a top-down construction of a metacard, and provides
more flexibility of implementation. The latter approach follows the pattern of a step-by-step wizard that builds the metacard over several steps, and then commits and validates the metacard
at the very end.</p>

<h4>Editing existing metacards</h4>

<p>The Component Builder framework also allows you to load an existing metacard, make changes to it, and then revalidate it. It might also be used to programmatically update or
correct errors in a collection of DDMS metacards. For example, if your assets have moved to a different web server, you could programmatically update all of your DDMS Identifiers
to point to the new location. Alternately, you could change all occurences of a producer's last name after a marriage.</p>

<p>As a specialized example of editing, you could transform older metacards to the latest version of DDMS. With the Component Builder framework, you could load a DDMS 2.0 metacard,
add all of the fields required for DDMS 5.0, and then save it as a DDMS 5.0 assertion. Example code for this use case can be found in the <a href="documentation-builders.jsp">Component Builder</a> Power Tip.</p>

<h4>Applying custom constraints with Schematron</h4>

<p>In many cases, schema validation is not sufficient to truly show conformance. The Intelligence Community codifies constraints on ISM attributes with a set of Schematron files. DDMSence
requires just a few lines of code to validate your DDMS metacards against these Schematron files. You could also validate against Schematron files developed by your Community of Interest.
Additional details can be found in the <a href="documentation-schematron.jsp">Schematron Validation</a> Power Tip.</p>

<div class="clear"></div>

<a name="design"></a><h3>Design Decisions</h3>

<p>This section identifies a few basic design principles of DDMSence which might affect you as incorporate it into your own projects.</p>

<h4>Components Deserving an Object</h4>

<p>Not all of the elements defined in the DDMS schema are implemented as Java Objects. Many elements are defined globally but only used once, or exist merely as wrappers for other components. I have
followed these rules to determine which components are important enough to deserve a full-fledged Object:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Elements which are explicitly declared as DDMS Categories in the DDMS documentation are always implemented (<code>ddms:identifier</code>).</li>
	<li>Elements which merely enclose important data AND which have no special attributes are never implemented (<code>ddms:Media</code>).</li>
	<li>Data which can be represented as a simple Java type AND which has no special attributes is represented as a simple Java type (<code>ddms:email</code>).</li>
	<li>Attributes are generally implemented as properties on an Object. The exceptions to this are the attributes which tend to be used together, such as the
		<a href="/docs/index.html?buri/ddmsence/ddms/security/ism/SecurityAttributes.html">ISM SecurityAttributes</a>, 
		which decorates many DDMS components.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Immutability</h4>

<p>All DDMS components are implemented as immutable objects, which means that their values cannot be changed after instantiation. Because the components are
validated during instantiation, this also means that it is impossible to have an invalid component at any given time: a component is either confirmed to be 
valid or does not exist. The <a href="documentation-builders.jsp">Component Builder</a> framework can be used to build DDMS Resources piece by piece, saving validation until the end.</li>
</p>

<h4>Empty String vs. No Value</h4>

<p>When analyzing <code>xs:string</code>-based components, DDMSence treats the absence of some element/attribute in the same manner as it would treat that element/attribute if it were
present but had an empty string as a value. A string-based accessor will always return an empty string instead of a <code>null</code> entity.</p>

<h4>Accessor Consistency Across Versions</h4>

<p>Some non-string-based attributes, such as <code>ism:excludeFromRollup</code> and <code>ism:resouceElement</code> do not appear in all versions of DDMS. When the accessors for 
these attributes are called on an older version, a null value will be returned. This decision allows DDMS records of varying versions to be
traversed and queried in the same manner, without requiring too much knowledge of when specific attributes were introduced.</p>

<h4>Lists of Strings</h4>

<p>In some instances, the DDMS specification supports multiple string values, either by multiple elements (<code>ddms:name</code> elements on a <code>ddms:person</code>)
or by supporting the <code>xsd:list</code> datatype (the <code>ism:ownerProducer</code> security attribute). The accessor methods for these fields in DDMSence will always deal with
a List of String values, rather than a space-separated String containing multiple values. However, because list management can be tedious, there is a shortcut utility method available:

<pre class="brush: java">// These two approaches to generating ownerProducers are equivalent.
List&lt;String&gt; ownerProducers = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
ownerProducers.add("AUS");
ownerProducers.add("USA");

List&lt;String&gt; ownerProducers = Util.getXsListAsList("AUS USA");</pre>
<p class="figure">Figure 3. Conveniently creating a list of Strings from a space-delimited String</p>

<h4>Thread Safety</h4>

<p>Other than the immutability of objects, no special effort went into making DDMSence thread-safe, and no testing was done on its behavior in multithreaded environments.</p>
